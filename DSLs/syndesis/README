1. downloaded syndesis crd from repo (not from openshift, we need openapi schema to be included)
2. fix the generator code to make use of `versions` (already done)
3. add `generateSyndesis` (already done)
4. ./gradlew :DSLs:schema-generator:generateSyndesis
5. ./gradlew :DSLs:syndesis:generator:run
6. might need to create directories and build.gradle files along the way, just copy what's in zookeeper
